description: Configure target AI agents for skill installation
---

Paks supports multiple AI coding agents out of the box. Each agent has a designated skills directory where skills are installed.

## Built-in Agents

| Agent | Skills Directory | Description |
| ----- | ---------------- | ----------- |
| `stakpak` | `~/.stakpak/skills` | Stakpak AI agent (default) |
| `claude-code` | `~/.claude/skills` | Anthropic Claude Code |
| `cursor` | `~/.cursor/skills` | Cursor IDE |
| `vscode` | `~/.vscode/skills` | VS Code with AI extensions |
| `copilot` | `~/.copilot/skills` | GitHub Copilot |
| `goose` | `~/.goose/skills` | Goose AI agent |
| `opencode` | `~/.opencode/skills` | OpenCode agent |

## Managing Agents

### List All Agents

```bash
paks agent list
```

Shows all configured agents (built-in and custom) with their skills directories.

### Add Custom Agent

```bash
paks agent add my-agent --dir ~/.my-agent/skills
```

Register a custom agent with a specific skills directory.

### Remove Custom Agent

```bash
paks agent remove my-agent
```

Only custom agents can be removed. Built-in agents are permanent.

### Set Default Agent

```bash
paks agent default claude-code
```

Set which agent is used when `--agent` flag is not specified.

### Show Agent Details

```bash
paks agent show stakpak
```

Display configuration details for a specific agent.

## Configuration File

Agent configurations are stored in `~/.paks/config.toml`:

```toml
default_agent = "stakpak"

[agents.my-custom-agent]
skills_dir = "~/.my-custom-agent/skills"
```

## Default Behavior

- When no `--agent` flag is provided, the default agent is used
- Default agent is `stakpak` unless changed with `paks agent default`
- If no agent is configured, skills install to `~/.paks/skills`
