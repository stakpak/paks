## What are Agent Skills?

Agent Skills are reusable packages of knowledge and instructions that enhance AI coding agents. They follow the [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io) and consist of:

- **SKILL.md** - A markdown file with YAML frontmatter containing metadata and instructions
- **Optional assets** - Scripts, templates, references, and other supporting files

Skills help AI agents understand domain-specific knowledge, coding standards, deployment procedures, and best practices that aren't part of their base training.

## Next Steps

2. **[Understand the SKILL.md format](/docs/skill-spec)** - Master the skill manifest specification
3. **[Configure your agents](/docs/agents)** - Set up skills for your preferred AI agents
4. **[Publish to the registry](/docs/commands#publish)** - Share your skills with the community
